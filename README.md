### Back-End Assessment

The goal of this assessment is to test your backend development skills. The objective is to write a simple JSON API.

The assessment will be graded based on the following criteria (so it is good practice to keep these categories in mind while completing this practice assessment):

- Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases?
- Code Organization, Readability, & Maintainability: Is your code easy to read and
  well organized?
- Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data
  structures?
- Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests,
  avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of
  choice?
